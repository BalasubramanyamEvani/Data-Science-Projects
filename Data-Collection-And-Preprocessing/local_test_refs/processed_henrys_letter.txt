letter
to
be
open
in
the
event
of
my
death
december
10
2006
dearest
clare
write
this
be
sit
at
my
desk
in
the
back
bedroom
look
out
at
your
studio
across
the
backyard
full
of
blue
even
snow
everything
be
slick
and
crusty
with
ice
and
it
be
very
still
it
one
of
those
winter
evening
when
the
coldness
of
every
single
thing
seem
to
slow
down
time
like
the
narrow
center
of
an
hourglass
which
time
itself
flow
through
but
slowly
slowly
have
the
feel
very
familiar
to
me
when
be
out
of
time
but
almost
never
otherwise
of
be
buoyed
up
by
time
float
effortlessly
on
it
surface
like
fat
lady
swimmer
have
sudden
urge
tonight
here
in
the
house
by
myself
you
be
at
alicia
recital
at
st
lucy
to
write
you
letter
suddenly
want
to
leave
something
for
after
think
that
time
be
short
now
feel
though
all
my
reserve
of
energy
of
pleasure
of
duration
be
thin
small
dont
feel
capable
of
continue
very
much
longer
know
you
know
if
you
be
reading
this
be
probably
dead
say
probably
because
you
never
know
what
circumstance
may
arise
it
seem
foolish
and
self
important
to
just
declare
one
own
death
an
out
and
out
fact
about
this
death
of
mine
hope
it
be
simple
and
clean
and
unambiguous
hope
it
didnt
create
too
much
fuss
im
sorry
this
read
like
suicide
note
strange
but
you
know
you
know
that
if
could
have
stayed
if
could
have
go
on
that
would
have
clutched
every
second
whatever
it
be
this
death
you
know
that
it
come
and
take
me
like
child
carry
away
by
goblin
clare
want
to
tell
you
again
love
you
our
love
have
be
the
thread
through
the
labyrinth
the
net
under
the
high
wire
walker
the
only
real
thing
in
this
strange
life
of
mine
that
could
ever
trust
tonight
feel
that
my
love
for
you
have
more
density
in
this
world
than
do
myself
though
it
could
linger
on
after
me
and
surround
you
keep
you
hold
you
hate
to
think
of
you
wait
know
that
you
have
be
wait
for
me
all
your
life
always
uncertain
of
how
long
this
patch
of
wait
would
be
ten
minute
ten
day
month
what
an
uncertain
husband
have
be
clare
like
sailor
odysseus
alone
and
buffet
by
tall
wave
sometimes
wily
and
sometimes
just
plaything
of
the
god
please
clare
when
be
dead
stop
wait
and
be
free
of
me
put
me
deep
inside
you
and
then
go
out
in
the
world
and
live
love
the
world
and
yourself
in
it
move
through
it
though
it
offer
no
resistance
though
the
world
be
your
natural
element
have
give
you
life
of
suspend
animation
dont
mean
to
say
that
you
have
do
nothing
you
have
create
beauty
and
meaning
in
your
art
and
alba
who
be
so
amaze
and
for
me
for
me
you
have
be
everything
after
my
mom
die
she
ate
my
father
up
completely
she
would
have
hat
it
every
minute
of
his
life
since
then
have
be
marked
by
her
absence
every
action
have
lack
dimension
because
she
be
not
there
to
measure
against
and
when
be
young
didnt
understand
but
now
know
how
absence
can
be
present
like
damage
nerve
like
dark
bird
if
have
to
live
on
without
you
know
could
not
do
it
but
hope
have
this
vision
of
you
walk
unencumbered
with
your
shin
hair
in
the
sun
have
not
see
this
with
my
eye
but
only
with
my
imagination
that
make
picture
that
always
want
to
paint
you
shin
but
hope
that
this
vision
will
be
true
anyway
clare
there
be
one
last
thing
and
have
hesitate
to
tell
you
because
im
superstitiously
afraid
that
tell
might
cause
it
to
not
happen
know
silly
and
also
because
have
just
be
go
on
about
not
wait
and
this
might
cause
you
to
wait
longer
than
you
have
ever
wait
before
but
will
tell
you
in
case
you
need
something
after
last
summer
be
sit
in
kendrick
wait
room
when
suddenly
found
myself
in
dark
hallway
in
house
dont
know
be
sort
of
tangle
up
in
bunch
of
galosh
and
it
smell
like
rain
at
the
end
of
the
hall
could
see
rim
of
light
around
door
and
so
go
very
slowly
and
very
quietly
to
the
door
and
look
in
the
room
be
white
and
intensely
lit
with
morning
sun
at
the
window
with
her
back
to
me
sat
woman
wear
coral
color
cardigan
sweater
with
long
white
hair
all
down
her
back
she
have
cup
of
tea
beside
her
on
table
must
have
make
some
little
noise
or
she
sense
me
behind
her
she
turn
and
saw
me
and
saw
her
and
it
be
you
clare
this
be
you
an
old
woman
in
the
future
it
be
sweet
clare

be
sweet
beyond
tell
to
come
though
from
death
to
hold
you
and
to
see
the
year
all
present
in
your
face
wont
tell
you
any
more
so
you
can
imagine
it
so
you
can
have
it
unrehearsed
when
the
time
come
it
will
it
do
come
we
will
see
each
other
again
clare
until
then
live
fully
present
in
the
world
which
be
so
beautiful
it
dark
now
and
be
very
tire
love
you
always
